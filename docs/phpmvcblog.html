<h2>Introduction and motivation</h2>

<p>I am very excited as this is my first article at nettuts and in this series of posts we will build a minimal MVC framework using Object oriented features of PHP
and build a real blog application.   The series will be spanned across 3 or 4 articles. If you follow along with me in this article by the 
time you reach the end of the series we will have a live blogging application deployed.  This will not be as feature rich as wordpress
but minimal enough to enforce the concepts learned during our stay here. The brief summary of contents
is outlined below for reference.

<h2>Introduction to MVC </h2>

<p>
MVC (Model View Controller) is one of the oldest presentation pattern available to the developers.  It has mostly been popularized by the Ruby On
Rails framework and later being adopted by many other vendors including PHP (CakePhp) and ASP.NET MVC and much more.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The crux of MVC is the CONTROLLER which handles all the request to any PHP files.  The CONTROLLER is the entry point to the system and is responsible for interacting
with the MODEL and loading the appropriate VIEW.
</p>
<p>
The relation between VIEW and the MODEL is very thin as the MODEL is passed to the VIEW by the CONTROLLER.

recommend this and its also opensource and available for free."</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Folder Structure</h2>
<p>
The folder structure for our application is shown in the below figure.
</p>

<div class="tutorial_image">
	<img src="images/folder_structure.png" border="0" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
Before proceeding further let's quickly glance over the folder structure.  This is a very early draft and may change as we 
proceed in this series.	
</p>

<ul>
	<li>app&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    -> Houses the core of the application including models, views and controllers</li>
	<li>config&nbsp;&nbsp -> Houses the configuration, constants and includes</li>
	<li>helpers -> Houses helper functions related to the core system functionalities</li>
	<li>public&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Houses images, javascripts and themes</li>	
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>Convention over Configuration</h2>
<p>There are couple of conventions which if we understand will ease application development.  </p>

<ul>
<li>All application CONTROLLERS will derive from AppController which in turn will be derived from ControllerBase class</li>
<li>All model will derive from Model class</li>  
<li>The views are plain old PHP file</li>  
<li>The Controller file names will be postfixed with "Controller"</li>  
<li>The default action if not specified will be "index".  We will have a detailed look at routing and other 
	related things as we go forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Front Controller (aka index.php)</h2>
<p>Without any more further ado lets get straight to THE FRONT CONTROLLER.  The FRONT CONTROLLER is the gateway to the
application.  All requests except (images, css, javascripts) passes through this.  We will have a look at how to set this up in the later part of the article.
</p>

<p>Create a index.php file in the root folder of your application and copy the following code into it.  It will set up the
front controller for the application.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">

&lt;?php
    session_start();

    require_once('config/includes.php');
    require_once('config/routes.php');
    require_once('dispatcher.php');

    Dispatcher::dispatch($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
?&gt;

</pre>

<h2>Explanation of index.php</h2>
<p>The index.php does the following things</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sets up the session</li>
	<li>Includes the essential configuration files</li>
	<li>Routes the request to the dispatcher.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Dispatcher::dispatch is a static method which takes the request URL as the input parameter
and routes the request to the appropriate action on the correct controller.
</p>

<p>We will be covering the dispatcher in the subsequent sections after going through the routing system.
</p>

<h2>The Routing System: The heart of MVC</h2>

<p>
Routing lies at the heart of the MVC system.  The first thing to setup is the .htaccess file.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule !(\.gif|\.png|\.jpe?g|\.css|\.js|\.php|^public/.*)$ index.php [nocase,last]
</pre>


The first line RewriteEngine On enable URL rewriting to work on apache. 

The second line is the RewriteRule which specifies for any request other than gif, png, jpeg/jpg, css, js, php or 
any request that starts with public should be redirected to index.php page.


Most of the webserver that has apached installed support the use of .htaccess files.  

<p>
For detailed information on .htaccess file do refer the docs at 

<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/htaccess.html" target="_blank" title="New Window">htaccess Guide</a>.


Apache rewrite guide can be found here 

<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/misc/rewriteguide.html" target="_blank" title="New Window">Rewrite Guide</a>.

A more detailed introduction to mod_rewrite can be found on the following nettuts article
 <a href=" http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/a-deeper-look-at-mod_rewrite-for-apache/" target="_blank" title="An In Depth Guide to mod_rewrite for Apache ">An In Depth Guide to mod_rewrite for Apache </a>

</p>

<p>
Enable apache mod_rewrite module.  You can do this by opening the apache config file and uncommenting or adding 
(if not aleady exist) the following entry.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="text">
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively if you are on windows and have WAMP installed, click on the WAMP server->Apache->Apache modules->rewrite_module option.
</p>

<h2>The Routing Table</h2>
<p>
The routing table is an array which holds the regex pattern for identifying controllers, actions and request parameters.

</p>

<div class="tutorial_image">
	<img src="images/route_table.png" border="0" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The code to setup the routes is in the /config/routes.php.  The routes are defined from specific to general.
</p>

<h2>Routes.php Explained</h2>
<p>The first route entry and the routes.php class is hown below (partial).  The routes are not yet very fool proof at this moment, but we will
get there before we conclude the series.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">
&lt;?php
class Routes
{
    public static $routes = array(
            // "/controller/id/action"
            array('url' => '/^(?P<controller>[a-zA-Z]\w+)\/(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+)\/(?P&lt;action&gt;[a-zA-Z]\w+)$/',
                              'name'=>'default1',
                              'controller'=>'master',
                              'action'=>'index');
}                       
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>We begin by creating a Routes class and declaring a static $routes array.  $routes holds all the regex patterns
for matching routes.  We won't be going into the details of all the route regex, except this one and rest will be easy to follow.
</p>

<p>
The above route serves the request with the incoming URL /controller/id/action format.  For e.g. for our future blogging system 
this will map to <b>/home/1/show</b>  URL where <b>"home"</b> maps to HomeController, <b>"1"</b> maps to $id = 1 and
<b>"show"</b> maps to the action "show" on the HomeController.
</p>

<h2>Dissecting the "/controller/id/action" route </h2>
<p>Each element of the above regex is explained below.
</p>

<h2>Capture "controller" name </h2>
<ul>
	<li>/  Begin regex expression.  In PHP regex are enclosed between /&lt;regex&gt;/</li>
	<li>^  Starts with </li>
	<li>(?P&lt;controller&gt;[a-zA-Z]\w+)  Start named group with the name "controller". Match all word characters 
		The closing parenthesis ")" marks the end of named group.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above pattern captures the controller text and stores it in the "controller" named group.
</p>


<h2>Capture the request parameter </h2>
<ul>
	<li>/ match the leading "/" in front of the parameter</li>
	<li>(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+) Captures the id in the named group "id".</li>
</ul>

<p>The above pattern captures the request parameter and  stores it in the named group "id".
</p>

<h2>Capture the action </h2>
<ul>
	<li>/ match the leading "/" in front of the action name</li>
	<li>(?P&lt;action&gt;[a-zA-Z]\w+)$/ Captures the action parameter in the named group "action".</li>
</ul>

<p>The above pattern captures the action parameter and  stores it in the  named group "action".
</p>

<h2>The Dispatcher</h2>

<p>The dispatcher does all the grunt work of parsing the incoming request and then instantiation the correct conroller
and invoking the action passing in the required parameters.
